# Project Name

Photo Gallery made with React and Material-UI

Deployed site: https://my-react-gallery.herokuapp.com/
- Click the link above for a fully-functional version of the app
- If images don't load after a minute, try adding an image and they should pop up. 


## Description

I built and styled this project in one weekend as my first project in React. A month before I started this project, I only knew vanilla javascript. In one month I learned how to write and deploy this full stack React app using node and postgresSQL.

The gallery allows you to add photos and descriptions, as well as like photos. I also added a feature to sort the photos by date added (id), likes, and description (alphabetical).

Features:
- Add photo
- Like photo
- Click picture to toggle between description and image
- Sorting photos by date added, likes, and description (sorting tab bar at bottom of page)
