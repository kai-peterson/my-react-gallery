# Project Name

Simple Photo Gallery made with React and Material-UI

Fully-functional deployed site: https://my-react-gallery.herokuapp.com/
- If images don't load, try adding an image and they should pop up

## Description

I built and styled this project in one weekend as my first project in React. A month before I started this project, I only knew vanilla javascript, and in the last month I learned how to write and deploy a full stack React app using node and postgresSQL.

The gallery allows you to add photos and descriptions, as well as like photos. I also added a feature to sort the photos by date added (id), likes, and description (alphabetical)

Features:
- Add photo
- Like photo
- Click picture to toggle between description and image
- Sorting photos by date added, likes, and description (sorting tab bar at bottom of page)
